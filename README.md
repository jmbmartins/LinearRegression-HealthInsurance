# Practical Project - Linear Regression Analysis of Health Insurance Charges


This practical project involves analyzing the "Medical Cost Personal Dataset" to predict health insurance charges using linear regression. The project includes steps such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, implementing a linear regression model using gradient descent, and evaluating the model performance using k-fold validation. Additionally, the project explores the differences in model performance across different folds and extends the analysis to fit polynomial models of varying orders.
