# Practical Project - Linear Regression Analysis of Health Insurance Charges

This repository contains the code and data for the Practical Project 1 on Linear Regression Analysis of Health Insurance Charges. The project involves analyzing the "Medical Cost Personal Dataset" to predict health insurance charges using linear regression models.

## Files Included:
- `Pratical_Project_01_Testing.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the project.
- `enunciado_p1_ml_23_24.pdf`: PDF file with the project guidelines.
- `graphics_features.py`: Python script for generating graphical representations of features.
- `insurance.csv`: Dataset containing the medical cost personal data.
- `linear_regression.py`: Python script for implementing linear regression using gradient descent.
- `linear_regression_polinomial.py`: Python script for fitting polynomial regression models.

## Instructions:
1. Run the `Pratical_Project_01_Testing.ipynb` notebook to see the implementation and analysis.
2. Use the provided scripts for linear regression and polynomial regression models.
3. Refer to the project guidelines in `enunciado_p1_ml_23_24.pdf` for detailed report.
